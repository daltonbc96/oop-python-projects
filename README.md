## About The Project

![Main Menu](images/mainMenu.png){: width=50% }

This is a Python project for practicing object-oriented programming concepts. This project allows users to create a checking or savings account and perform financial transactions between accounts.

This project allowed me to practice the concepts of inheritance, abstract classes using the [ABC](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) @abstractmethod annotation or decorator, overriding, and polymorphism. In addition, an interactive menu was created so that the user could operate the application through the terminal.

The application includes classes and methods for creating accounts and performing financial transactions. You can create different current or savings accounts, check the balance, and carry out the following financial transactions: withdrawal, transfer, and deposit. See the list of features below. 

### Features 

- Create Account
  - Checking Account
